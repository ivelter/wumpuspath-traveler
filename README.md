The git repo for my personal, private Discord Bot. It's a personal project I've been working on for a while on my free time (which, considering I'm a college student, is close to non existent).

## To-do list (in order)
[ ] Fix what's been broken by recent Discord updates (I love the discriminator changes!)

[ ] Add the new super secret feature that is totally not inspired by my now-dead Twitter bot (I love what the Muskie did to Twitter- I mean X)

[ ] Prefix changing feature

[ ] Finally get done with that SQL db migration stuff

[ ] Get working on the actual RPG stuff

## Features and commands
Not much, for now

|    Category   |   Command   |
|:-------------:|:-----------:|
|      Fun      |  `$helpfun` |
|      RPG      |  `$helprpg` |
| Miscellaneous | `$helpmisc` |

The prefix is `$` and can't be changed because I do not have the time to make it so that you can change it.

I aim to work on the RPG aspect of the bot first.
