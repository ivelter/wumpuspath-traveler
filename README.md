# ⚠️ Putting this project aside until further notice.
I'd like to focus on my studies and smaller-scale projects for now. If I ever get back to making Discord bots, I will probably start over as some of the things I have implemented (mostly the database system) would be tricky to maintain as they are.

The git repo for my personal, private Discord Bot. It's a personal project I've been working on for a while on my free time (which, considering I'm a college student, is close to non existent).

## To-do list (in order)
- [X] Fix what's been broken by recent Discord updates (I love the discriminator changes!)
- [X] Add the new super secret feature that is totally not inspired by my now-dead Twitter bot (I love what the Muskie did to Twitter- I mean X)
- [ ] Prefix changing feature
- [ ] Finally get done with that SQL db migration stuff
- [ ] Get working on the actual RPG stuff
